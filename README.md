# ClickUp Clone Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for a ClickUp-like application.

## Backend
- FastAPI app located in `backend/app` with placeholder authentication and task endpoints.
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.

## Frontend
- React application under `frontend/src` demonstrating login, protected routes, list and calendar views.

This code is a lightweight starting point that can be expanded with full database models and advanced features.
